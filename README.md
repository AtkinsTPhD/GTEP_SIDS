# GTEP_SIDS
This repository includes input file and GAMS code for our research project on "Long-term infrastructure investment planning for the electricity sector in Small Island Developing States: Case for Jamaica".
The file "Input_GTEPJA_Anonymized.xlsx" is the input file for the GAMS programs.
The file "GTEPJA_BaselineFuelPrice.gms"contain sripts for running GAMS programs for the reference case (i.e. baseline fuel price scenarios). By toggling through lines of code that have been "commented" out, different scenarios can be run.

To run the script, you will need a more advanced GAMS license than the free GAMS license. It may also be advantageous to use the available "$ontext" and "$offtext" commands to selectively run one model at a time.

Please see the "LICENSE.txt" file for academic free license. You may use these files for reproducing work or advancing your own research. We however kindly ask that you credit us with providing the input file and program codes (Atkinson, Preckel and Gotham, 2020).
