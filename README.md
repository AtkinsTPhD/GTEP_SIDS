# GTEP_SIDS
This repository includes input file and GAMS code for our research project on "Long-term infrastructure investment planning for the electricity sector in Small Island Developing States: Case for Jamaica".
The file "Input_GTEPJA_Anonymized.xlsx" is the input file for the GAMS programs.
The files "GTEPJA_BaselineFuelPrice.gms", "GTEPJA_HighFuelPrice.gms" and "GTEPJA_LowFuelPrice.gms" contain sripts for running GAMS programs for the baseline, high and low fuel price scenarios.
To run these files, you will need a more advanced GAMS license than the free GAMS license.
